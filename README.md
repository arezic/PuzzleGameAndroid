This is a 2D puzzle game made in Android Studio. The objective is to guess the correct combination of images in one of 6 attempts. Each attempt will give the user feedback on the number of correctly guessed images. For each correctly guessed image a red circle is displayed. If an image is within the correct combination but it's in the wrong spot a yellow circle is displayed. The total and daily number of games played is tracked and displayed on the main activity. It uses a local SQLite database to store the data. The programming language used is Kotlin.
